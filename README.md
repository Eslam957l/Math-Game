​🎮##Math Game Project
​A simple C++ console-based game designed to test mental math skills. This project was developed as a practical application of C++ fundamentals.

​📝## Description
​The game challenges users with random mathematical questions and evaluates their answers. It's a great way to practice logical thinking and basic arithmetic while learning the core concepts of C++.

​🚀 ##Key Features & Concepts Used
​In this project, I implemented several programming fundamentals:
​Loops: Used to handle multiple rounds and repeat questions.
​Arrays: Used for storing data and managing game results.
​Functions: Used to organize the code into logical, reusable blocks.
​Conditions: Used to validate user input and determine correct answers.
